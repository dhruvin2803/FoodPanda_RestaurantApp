# FoodPanda RestaurantApp
## 1. Problem
During this COVID-19 period, people around the world are finding difficulties and are having 
hard times going out of their houses and buying food for them. Many of the employees who are 
willing to work have lost their jobs. So, I thought to make a mobile application which will help 
people to order the food online and the employees who lost their job can work and provide 
them food at their respective houses. The name of my application is Food Panda. “The Food 
You Like the Food We Bring” is the motivation statement of this mobile application.

## 2. Wireframing and UI Description:- 
The user will be asked to login/signup in the application so that he can access the further 
features. Then If the user signs in, then app will show the list of all the nearby restaurants 
according to user’s address. Then if user selects the restaurant it will display the list of food 
items available in that restaurant. The data for the order can be updated or deleted by the user. 
Once the order is placed, the order data will be stored in our database and the further details of 
order and the delivery details will be sent to restaurant and drivers, respectively. The restaurant 
employees will be given an option whether to accept the order or to decline it. 
Here are some photos of the wireframe designs that I have made in order to understand the UI 
of the application:
